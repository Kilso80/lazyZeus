Are you lazy enough to hate Zeus but not enough to use [zeusToCalendar](https://github.com/Kilso80/zeusToCalendar)? If so this extention is for you, no more redundant logging in, we're here to do it for you.

**Warning !** This will **NOT** automatically select your group class. I removed this feature since this is an existing parameter, just go to your settings (top-right account icon > Favori) and select your class.
